## Personal Portfolio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a personal portfolio project showing my employment history, skills, hobbies, interest and other development projects. It will showcase various skills, techniques and technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, that I have learnt and encountered throughout the course, to which I will then apply to creating my first milestone project.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes. This project is the first of many project and will be the main foundation for my other development projects, as I continue to learn, grow and progress throughout the course I will add more technologies to help me advertise my skills and experience to future employers.


## UX – User Experience

### The who?
The websites sole purpose is to display my development skills for future employers and job recruiters. Not only will it display my development skills but will also advertise my work experiences, education, extra skills, hobbies and interest.

### The what?
This website will help future employers and recruiters get a better understanding of myself through a number of easy digestible web pages that are advertising and showing off my work experiences, education, hobbies, interest and skills as well as my development skills which will have live links to my other projects.

They will also be able to view my CV in a pdf format online and will have the option to download the CV as well. The website will also have a contact form, so that future employers and recruiters can get in direct contact with me through the website.

### The how?
All the information will be taken from my CV and then changed, to give it more of an elegant style and then broken down into easy digestible chunks which will get website visitors straight to the point.

The website will also incorporate an eye catching design that will draw website visitors into know more about myself by visiting the other web pages. If the website visitor want to know more they will be able to view and download my CV with link provided by me. I will also incorporate a built in contact form that will allow visitors to get in direct contact with me. Live links to my other projects will also be provided for the users so that they can visit my other projects and see my development skills live.

# Testing

Here in this section I will be conducting a variety of different test to thoroughly make sure my project website is fully functioning. I will also do HTML5 validation a CSS3 validation using the online W3C validation tools and a contrast checker to make sure my colours meet web accessibility standard.

HTML5 Validation -> [Visit Site]( https://validator.w3.org/)
CSS3 Validation -> [Visit Site]( https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
WebAIM Contrast Checker -> [Visit Site]( https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

### HTML5 & CSS3 Validation

I have chosen to do the HTML5 and CSS3 validation first because this will reveal any non-compliant code within my project. If there is any non-compliant code this will be the first step of testing and debugging.

#### Homepage (index.html)

After running the HTML5 online validation, the results came in that my button elements could not be a descendant of the a element.

PDF File Link Here With Errors -> [Visit PDF](https://github.com/ifti-khan/ifti-khan-milestone-project-1/blob/master/validation/html5/homepage_validation_results_with_errors.pdf)

To make the code compliant I had to remove the a element and contain the button element inside of a form element. I also had to put the href link in the form action and change the button type from button to submit.

#### Resume Page (my_resume.html)

After running the HTML5 online validation, the results came in that I was using the center element which is obsolete and that I had to use CSS to center my elements. I was using an attribute incorrectly, I called it date-education and date-history. Another issue is that I mistakenly gave a bad value to one of the progress bars.
PDF File Link Here With Errors -> [Visit PDF](https://github.com/ifti-khan/ifti-khan-milestone-project-1/blob/master/validation/html5/resume_page_validation_results_with_errors.pdf)

To make the code compliant I got rid of the center elements and created a classes for the elements. Then I used the CSS the margin-left and margin-right auto to center my elements. I then fixed the attribute error very easily because I made a simple name mistake, because I had put date instead of data. The last fix was also easy and found in my JavaScript progress bar, I changed the bad value from 100% to 100.

#### Project Page (my_projects.html)

After running the HTML5 online validation, the results came in same as my index.html that my button could not be a descendant from an a element. Also my comment line was too long and had to be shortened.

PDF File Link Here With Errors -> [Visit PDF](https://github.com/ifti-khan/ifti-khan-milestone-project-1/blob/master/validation/html5/project_page_validation_results_with_errors.pdf)

To make the code compliant I had shortened the comment lines as well as removing the a elements. I then added in a form elements for the buttons and made the form actions linked to the websites URLs.

#### Contact Page (contact_me.html)

After running the HTML5 online validation, the contact page came out with no errors.

### Main CSS (style.css)

After running the CSS3 online validation, the results came in and I had no errors, but I did have a warning of which doesn’t impact the CSS3 validation. The warning was in regards to the google font imports I have done in my CSS file.

### Media Queries (media_queries.css)

After running the CSS3 online validation, the results came in and I had no errors or warnings.

### Contrast Checker

Here below I have shown the online contrast checker that I used, the reason I had chosen to do this is to make sure that my project meets accessibility standards. The screenshot below shows that the background colour and foreground colour that I was using in my header and footer element did pass majority of the web accessibility contrast check but failed on one check. The original background colour used in my header element is #888888 and foreground colour #000000.

![Contrast Checker Fail](#url)

So I then decided to change my background colour for my header and footer element to a lighter colour and keep the foreground colour the same. The new background colour I have chosen is #D3D3D3, this is a lighter grey than the previous colour and it passed all the web accessibility contrast check criteria.

![Contrast Checker Pass](#url)

### Further Testing

When it comes to testing and debugging I find it easier to test and debug as I go along whilst I am developing. Every time I started a new page or section for my project I made sure that I fully tested to make sure it worked correctly. This can be seen in my Git commit messages to my repository every time I pushed my completed files. Here in this section I will do the final testing for my whole project and test against my user stories.
