# Ifti Khan Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

## Personal Portfolio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a personal portfolio project showing my employment history, skills, hobbies, interest and other development projects. It will showcase various skills, techniques and technologies that I have learnt and encountered throughout the course, to which I will then apply to creating my first milestone project.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes. This project is the first of many project and will be the main foundation for my other development projects and will help me advertise my skills and experience to future employers.

## UX - User Experience

###The who?
The websites sole purpose is to display my development skills for future employers and job recruiters. Not only will it display my development skills but will also advertise my work experiences, education, extra skills, hobbies and interest.

###The what?
This website will help future employers and recruiters get a better understanding of myself through a number of easy digestible web pages that are advertising and showing off my work experiences, education, skills as well as my development skills which will have live links to my other projects, hobbies and interest.

They will also be able to view my CV in a pdf format online and will have the option to do download the CV as well. The website will also have a contact form, so that future employers and recruiters can get in direct contact with me through my website.

###The how?
All the information will be taken from my plain old CV and then changed, to give it more of an elegant style and then broken down into easy digestible chunks which will get website visitors straight to the point.

The website will also incorporate an eye catching design that will draw website visitors in to know more about myself by visiting the other web pages. If the website visitor want to know more they will be able to view and download my CV with link provided by me.

I will also incorporate a built in contact form that will allow visitors to get in direct contact with me. Live links to my other projects will also be provided for the users so that they can visit my other projects and see my development skills live.
