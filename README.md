# Ifti Khan Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

This repository is show casing my first milestone project for The Code Institute.
I have chosen to do a personal portfolio website showing my employment history, my skills, hobbies, intrest and other development project i have done.

It will showcase a variety of skills, techiniques and technologies learned and then used to create this project. This project will be responsive so that it can be viewed and accessible on all device sizes.

This project is the first of many project and will be the main foundation for my other development projects and will help me advertise my skills and experience to future employers.
