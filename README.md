# Ifti Khan Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

## Personal Portfolio

### Introduction

This repository is showcasing my first milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a personal portfolio project showing my employment history, skills, hobbies, interest and other development projects. It will showcase various skills, techniques and technologies that I have learnt and encountered throughout the course, to which I will then apply to creating my first milestone project.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes. This project is the first of many project and will be the main foundation for my other development projects and will help me advertise my skills and experience to future employers.
