# Further Testing

I will test in sections, I chosen this method because the header, navigation and footer elements will remain the same on every webpage, the only section that will be different is the main content section of each webpage.

When it comes to browser testing I will test everything listed below in Chrome, Edge, Firebox and Opera and the responsiveness as well. If everything displays and works correctly then I will pass it, if it passes then that means it has been fully tested in all browsers and is responsive.
